The following 3D animation using HTML and CSS was created by PINKWEB https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDAfjhhB0-WHFQgakvOhfyQ
The original code has been modified: HTML: remove wrapper and replace with container, CSS: remove wrapper and replace with container, used flexbox for 
sphere to adjust and remain centered in container at all times.
I take no credit for the original code. 
Thank you to PINKWEB for providing this amazing 3D-Sphere
